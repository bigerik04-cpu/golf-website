      <h2>What is Golf?</h2>
      <p>
        Golf is a sport where you hit a ball into a series of holes using clubs.
        The goal is to finish each hole in the fewest strokes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical round is 18 holes, and players use different clubs for different distances and situations.
